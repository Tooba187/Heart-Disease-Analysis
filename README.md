# Heart Disease Analysis Project

#Overview
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset containing 303 patient records and 14 attributes, including demographics, medical test results, and a target variable indicating heart disease presence and stages (0-4). The aim is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the factors influencing heart disease and visualize key patterns.

#Tasks Performed:
General Information: Analyzed dataset shape and missing values.
Target Variable Analysis: Explored the distribution of heart disease stages.
Demographics: Investigated patient age range and gender distribution.
Health Metrics: Calculated average and median values for key health indicators like cholesterol and maximum heart rate.
Categorical Features: Analyzed exercise-induced angina and chest pain types.
Visualizations: Created plots for age distribution, cholesterol levels, and health metrics across different heart disease stages.
This analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between health metrics and the presence of heart disease.
